# iCloud Reminders Windows

This project offers a native Windows application via Electron for accessing iCloud reminders and other content available on [icloud.com](https://www.icloud.com/). 
Unlike Apple's official iCloud for Windows, which focuses on managing iCloud Drive, Photos, and Bookmarks, this client specifically targets reminders and always defaults to iCloud Reminders.

## Features

- **System Tray Integration**: The app runs in the system tray, keeping your iCloud session alive even when the window is closed. This helps maintain your login state longer.
- **Click to Toggle**: Click the tray icon to show/hide the main window.
- **Right-Click Menu**: Right-click the tray icon to access quick options:
  - **Show iCloud Reminders**: Opens the main window.
  - **Quit**: Fully exits the application.
- **Start with Windows**: Once signed in, the app can be will start automatically with Windows.

## Setup

1. **Releases**: Download the latest release of the application.
2. **Sign in to your iCloud account**: Upon launching the application, sign in to your iCloud account to access your reminders.
3. **Enjoy!**: Once signed in, you can seamlessly view and manage your iCloud reminders within the Windows environment.

**Note**: Closing the window hides the app to the system tray instead of quitting. To fully exit, right-click the tray icon and select "Quit".
